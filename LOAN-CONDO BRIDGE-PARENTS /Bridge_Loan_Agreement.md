NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein, the Parties agree as follows:

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THE LOAN

The Parties explicitly acknowledge and agree that the sole purpose of this Bridge Loan ("Loan") is to cover fixed mortgage-related costs directly associated with maintaining and preserving the Marital Property for the specified mortgage statement periods listed above. The Loan proceeds constitute marital debt under Pennsylvania law and are intended exclusively for the benefit of the marital estate.

---

## 2. LOAN AMOUNT AND DISBURSEMENT DETAILS

The total principal amount of the Loan is **Twelve Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($12,500)**, disbursed by the Lenders to the Borrower via four separate checks as detailed above and documented in Exhibit A.

---

## 3. INTEREST-FREE LOAN

The Parties expressly agree that this Loan shall be **interest-free**. No interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Loan at any time.

---

## 4. REPAYMENT TERMS AND PRIORITY DISTRIBUTION

The Borrower agrees that repayment of this Loan shall have priority distribution from the proceeds upon the sale, refinancing, or transfer of ownership interest in the Marital Property. Specifically:

- Upon sale or disposition of the Marital Property, the Loan shall be repaid in full from the proceeds before any distribution of remaining proceeds to Borrower or any other party.  
- If the total proceeds available from the sale or disposition of the Marital Property are insufficient to repay the full Loan amount of $12,500, the remaining unpaid balance shall automatically carry over into a new loan agreement ("Carryover Loan").

---

## 5. CARRYOVER LOAN TERMS

In the event that proceeds from the sale or disposition of the Marital Property are insufficient to fully repay the Loan, the remaining unpaid balance shall be converted into a Carryover Loan under the following terms:

- The Carryover Loan shall remain **interest-free**.
- The Borrower agrees to repay the Carryover Loan in quarterly installments, each installment equal to 25% of the total remaining loan balance.
- Quarterly payments shall commence ninety (90) days following the date of the sale or disposition of the Marital Property and continue every ninety (90) days thereafter until the Carryover Loan is fully repaid.

---

## 6. MARITAL LIABILITY AND EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION

The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree:

- Under Pennsylvania law, marital debts incurred during the marriage for the benefit, preservation, or maintenance of marital property are subject to equitable distribution between spouses upon dissolution of marriage (23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 3501-3502).
- The Marital Property described herein was acquired during the marriage and is thus subject to equitable distribution pursuant to Title 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3502(a), providing for equitable division of marital assets and debts without regard to marital misconduct.
- Consequently, this Loan constitutes marital debt, and both spouses, including Borrower's spouse (though unnamed herein), shall be jointly and severally responsible for repayment under applicable Pennsylvania law governing marital debts and equitable distribution.

---

## 7. COLLATERAL AND SECURITY INTEREST

The Parties acknowledge that the Marital Property itself serves as collateral securing this Loan. The Borrower agrees not to encumber, pledge, or compromise the collateral without prior written consent from the Lenders.

---

## 8. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

In the event of default, including non-payment or violation of any term of this Agreement, the Lenders reserve the right to exercise all available legal remedies under Pennsylvania law, including but not limited to enforcement against the Marital Property as collateral.

---

## 9. GOVERNING LAW

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, specifically referencing Title 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 3501-3502 regarding equitable distribution of marital property and debts.

---

## 10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENTS

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties and may only be amended or modified by a written agreement signed by all Parties.

---

## IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Bridge Loan Agreement as of the date first written above.
